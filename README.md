[Link to live site](https://nsantander1095.github.io/nsantander-portfolio/)

My portfolio is a full stack application using the MERN Stack and Bootstrap to handle the layout of the app. The goal is to present relavent material applied to my career building journey, as well as showcasing the portfolio app as a piece of my work unto itself.
