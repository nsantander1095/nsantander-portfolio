## Description

[Link to live site](https://nsantander1095.github.io/nsantander-portfolio/)

My portfolio is a full stack application using the MERN Stack and Bootstrap to handle the layout of the app. The goal is to present relavent material applied to my career building journey, as well as showcasing the portfolio app as a piece of my work unto itself. This project is currently in development. Needs a lot of work on the structure of the pages and the design. I have decided to go with a purple layout but we still need to nail down the structure.

Visuals to come! Updating the design of the site.
